[0x00] Introduction

This post aims to clarify some concepts about the full disk encryption based on
LUKS [1] (Linux Unified Key Setup). We will discuss some security flaws of a 
specific implementation of LUKS, namely Cryptsetup [2].

An academic paper covering this topic was presented at CANS 2015 [3], and can be
found <a href="http://ia.cr/2016/274" target="_blank">here</a>.

Cryptsetup is the most used high-level utility in hard disk encryption on 
GNU/Linux, it's based on dm-crypt [4] kernel module and relays on libgcrypt as
the default crypto-backend library. Note that Cryptsetup can be configured with
a number of other libraries, and libgcrypt is only the default one.



[0x01] The LUKS format

The LUKS format is a disk-encryption specification designed by Clemens 
Fruhwirth in 2005. The specification employs a TKS2 [5] schema with a two level
key hierarchy, so the encrypted master key is stored on the disk, and recovered
when the partition is unlocked. 

The master key, generated at installation time, is encrypted with a symmetric 
block cipher (XTS-AES-128 by default), using a key deriverd from a user provided
password by PBKDF2, that provides some resistance against brute-force attacks 
[6].

The LUKS format provides up to 8 key matherial sections (KM), each one can
contain a copy of the same master key, encrypted with a different password;
this allow different users to use different passwords to decrypt the same disk.

The LUKS header looks like:

    +---------+-----+-----+-----+-----+---------------------------------+
    | pheader | KM1 | KM2 | ... | KM8 |    User    encrypted    data    |
    +---------+-----+-----+-----+-----+---------------------------------+

The partition header (pheader) contains information about salts, iteration 
counts for PBKDF2, key slots, used cipher, cipher mode, key length, hash 
function, etc. These informations don't need to be kept private, so they're not
encrypted.



[0x02] Cryptsetup

The most famous implementation of LUKS is the Linux Cryptsetup utility, which
makes use of the Dm-crypt kernel module for real-time encryption and decrytpion.

LUKS employs PBKDF2 against user passwords, the usual burning aspect demanded to
applications is the PBKDF2's iteration counts: too much iterations mean an
unusable system while too few of them will deliver an insufficient level of
security.

Cryptsetup establishes this parameter by performing some tests on the machine at
installation time, but we found that many unexpected factors can affect 
negatively these tests; allowing an attacker to recover the master key faster 
than expected. The tests are done using the Libgcrypt's PBKDF2 function 
implementation since libgcrypt is the default library.

As shown in the "master key recovery process schema", the user-provided
passphrase, the salt and the iteration count are provided to PBKDF2 to get a
key for the decryption of the master key, which has been stored and split-up on
disk as anti-forenic technique. At this point the master key's chunks are merged 
and become a candidate master key, ready to be checked.

In the TKS2 schema the check is done by applying once again PBKDF2 on the candidate
key and comparing the result to a previously computed fingerprint, which is also
stored on disk, in its partition header.



[0x03] Exploiting EXT filesystem structure

             =======================================================          
             E   X   T         F   I   L   E   S   Y   S   T   E   M          
   +---------=======================================================---------+

   |   0   | BLOCK | DESC. |     |    BITMAP   | BITMAP | TABLE |   BLOCKS   |
   |-------+-------+-------+-----+-------------+--------+-------+------------|
   | 1024  |  ...  |  ...  | ... |     ....    |  ....  |  ...  |    ....    |
   | BYTES |       |       |     |             |        |       |            |
   +-------+-------+-------+-----+-------------+--------+-------+------------+

In our analysis we found that the previously described key checking process
is neither the only method to check a candidate master key, and unfortunatelly
nor the faster.

It's possible to check the EXT's "GROUP 0", that in the case of an encrypted 
LUKS partition is not used to boot-up the system, but filled with zeros instead.
Looking at the master key recovery schema, we noticed that the 
encrypted-partition's "GROUP 0" content can be exploited so that during the 
key checksum process we skip the standard candidate key check method (2nd PBKDF2
call) by decrypting 16 (one AES block) out of the 1024 bytes of "GROUP 0" 
instead.
The candidate key is the correct one if the result of the decryption matches the 
zeros previously witten in "GROUP 0". This saves about 20% of the time used by
the whole derivation process.

As you can see in scheme of the master key recovery process there are two
iteration counts involved in the key management. The first one is used in the 
first key-derivation process, while the second one is involved in the master key
check process (the second key-derivation).
The first derivation covers about the 75% of the computational effort
required by the whole process, the second the remaining 25%.

Table 1 and 2 dipicts this behavour. We report the data collected encrypting a
disk using different CPUs, repeating each test 10-times to ensure the test is
not influenced by external factors.

In particular, Table 1 reports the iteration count for PBKDF2 established by 
Cryptsetup for the key-derivation when different hash functions are employed, 
while Table 2 reports the related iteration count for the master key check.

[0x04] The impact of hash functions

Another inconsistance revealed by our analysis is the variation in the iteration
counts observed by varying the hash function used in PBKDF2. 

It sounds quite strange that the iteration count resolved by Cryptsetup is
higher using SHA1 then using more secure hash functions such as SHA256 or
SHA512. We experimentally collected a number of partition headers using
different hash functions, and as you can see in Tables 1 and 2, more secure hash
functions always come with a smaller iteration count.
We wanted to know more, hence we tryied to compute a set of 250.000 master
key candidates using different hash functions with the same number of iterations
(500.000):

                  MINs

FIGURE 1: Time spent to computing a set of 250,000 master key candidates.

Analyzing the test results we can deduce that computing a set of candidate keys 
based on SHA-2 costs less than the same set based on SHA-1, so on equal 
iterations it's easier to attack a FDE solution which make use of a safer hash
function!

Digging a bit deeper in PBKDF2 clarifies this issue. 

Let's assume we're generating a key for AES-256 which is the default choice for 
Cryptsetup, so we will ask PBKDF2 for a 32-bytes key.
In order to compute such a key with SHA-1, PBKDF2 is required to compute 2 
fingerprints, as the SHA-1 output is only 20 bytes in length.
Hash functions in the SHA-2 family generates enough bytes with
just one shot (1 digest) instead, so we are required to compute less hashes. 
This means, that on equal iterations values, it is easier to attack PBKDF2 based
on SHA-2 family than PBKDF2 based on SHA-1 !!

Wait a sec!, didn't we say earlier that hash functions are computed by runtime
benchmarking the system?
Shouldn't this mechanism avoid running into these problems...?
So, we reviewed the code of Cryptsetup v1.6.8 and we found that the
benchmark wasn't properly made, allowing this anomalous behaviour.

In particular, the installation-time benchmark was made asking PBKDF2 for a 
1-byte output key.
This way, indepentently from the underlying hash function, PBKDF2 is forced to
compute only one fingerprint!! But when Cryptsetup is asked to derive the 
encryption key from the user passphrase, PBKDF2 is asked for providing a 
32-byte key.
This means that in the case of SHA1 it's necessary to compute two hashes,
while for SHA512 it's necessary only one.
That said PBKDF2 will compute double the hashes when SHA1 is used,
so an attacker will also need double the effort to brute-force the corrispondent
key, then SHA1 better protects the user passphrase compared to SHA512.

So it seems that Cryptsetup just imposes a double iteration count when using 
SHA1, and the correct one when using hashes from the SHA2 family. 
This is not a problem in the case of SHA1 we will have double the security.
But.. .analysing deeper the LUKS_set_key function we discovered that the 
iteration count obtained by the benchmark was decreased by a factor 2, in 
particular:

==================================[keymanage.c]=================================
PBKDF2_temp = (*PBKDF2_per_sec / 2) * (uint64_t)iteration_time_ms;
BKDF2_temp /= 1024;
if (PBKDF2_temp > UINT32_MAX)
   PBKDF2_temp = UINT32_MAX;
   hdr->keyblock[keyIndex].passwordIterations = at_least((uint32_t)PBKDF2_temp,
                                                     LUKS_SLOT_ITERATIONS_MIN);
================================================================================

So it is not true that the iteration count is doubled for SHA1. Instead, due to
that division, the iteration count will be correct when SHA1 is used, and halved
when using hash functions that provides enough bytes in one fingerprint!



[0x05] Power management

From the collected encrypted partitions we also noticed that an important
role is played by the power management employed. Infact often with the intent
of saving battery, users enables aggressive power saving policies, which
impact performance by lowering CPU clock frequence.

Guess what?!
Encrypting a disk in a similar condition means reducing even more the iteration
count established by crytpsetup's benchmark test!!!

In Table 3 we report a comparison between the iterations counts when using power
saving policies against full CPU power. These tests are made by installing
Laptop Mode Tools version 1.66.



[0x06] PBKDF2 implementation

The last weakness we found in our analysis is related to the PBKDF2 
implementation adopted in Cryptsetup. 
As explained in our previous post [6], it's possible to compute PBKDF2 in half
the time implementing the HMAC optimization described in both FIPS 198-1 [7] and
RFC 2104 [8], but a lot of libraries still don't implement it.
(see also Joe Birr-Pixton awesome talk at Passwords15 [9]).

We recall that the default configuration of Cryptsetup relies on libgcrypt,
which didn't implement the improvement till our discussion [10] although
this PBKDF2 vulnerability seems overaged to someone.

PBKDF2 performances are important in a context like this, since the iteration 
count used to protect the user password from bruteforce attacks is determined by
cryptsetup, benchmarking the system. The default is as many rounds as needed for
1 second of PBKDF2 computation. A slow implementation of PBKDF2 means a lower 
security level, that is less rounds in one second.



[0x07] Skul

Skul is a PoC we coded to bruteforce the Cryptsetup implementation of LUKS.
It has been used for all the tests reported here using OpenSSL implementation of 
PBKDF2.

On August 2015 a highly optimized version of PBKDF2 was presented at Password15 
[9], we merged this implementation in our PoC, that can be found <a href="https://github.com/cryptcoffee/skul" target="_blank">here</a>.



[0x08] Conclusions

We cooperated with the mantainers of both Cryptsetup and Ligbcrypt to fix the 
presented weaknesses [11, 10].

When it comes to the power management, it's not strictly Cryptsetup's concern.
We suggest to disable Laptop mode and any other power saving policy while 
encrypting your disk, since these may interfere with the CPU frequency 
management.
