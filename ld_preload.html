|---------------------------------          trick         ----------------------------------|
|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|

This post aim to explain one relatively old trick, based on a very powerfull feature of the
dynamic linker of most modern Unix-based system. Library preloading. 
I'm using gcc 5.2.0 on a 64bit Linux box with 4.2.1-1-ARCH.

Look at this code

	#include&lt;stdio.h&gt;
	int main(){
		printf("%s","\n\nI am an innocent print.. \n\n");
		return 0;
	}

Try compiling this simple program with

# gcc ex.c -o ex

gcc by deafult should build a dynamically linked elf, that will use a shared library, 
it's possible to list the shared libraries dependencies of by a binary with ldd.


[ax@c0ffee]$ ldd ex 
	linux-vdso.so.1 (0x00007ffcb35f8000)
	libc.so.6 => /usr/lib/libc.so.6 (0x00007f9d32bb3000)
	/lib64/ld-linux-x86-64.so.2 (0x00007f9d32f57000)


You should never employ ldd on an untrusted executable,	since this may result in the
execution of arbitrary code. A safer alternative when dealing with untrusted executables is:


[ax@c0ffee]$ objdump -p ex | grep NEEDED
	NEEDED               libc.so.6


But in this case we work on a trusted binary, right?

The programs ld.so and ld-linux.so*, aka the dynamic linker/loader, find and load the
shared objects (shared libraries) needed by a program, prepare the program to run,
and then run it.

The dynamic linker can be run indirectly by running some dynamically linked program
or shared object.

LD_PRELOAD is an environment variable used by the dynamic linker,
it can contain a list of additional, user-specified, ELF shared objects to be loaded before
all others. The items of the list can be separated by spaces or colons.
This can be used to selectively override functions in other shared objects. 

This mean we may override the printf in the previous example and get the program
to do something different.

Write an evil_printf.c like this:

	#define _GNU_SOURCE
	#include&lt;stdlib.h&gt;
	#include&lt;stdio.h&gt;

	int printf(const char *format, ...){
		puts("Running very evil code...");
		exit(123);
	}

Compile it into a shared library with:

#	gcc -fPIC -Wall -c -o evil_printf.o evil_printf.c		
#	gcc -shared -o libevil_printf.so evil_printf.o

When you invoke GCC, it normally does preprocessing, compilation, assembly and linking.
The "overall options" allow you to stop this process at an intermediate stage.
For example, the -c option says not to run the linker.
Then the output consists of object files output by the assembler.

Put in $LD_PRELOAD the absolute path to our new shiny shared library.

#	export LD_PRELOAD=$PWD/libevil_printf.so

Run the example program, nothing showed up.

[ax@c0ffee]$ ./ex 


This is an innocent print.. 


Nothing strange, our evil print has not showed up. Seems that our trick doesn't work or
something goes wrong.

Take a look at the dynamic library calls of the binary with:

# ltrace ./ex

[ax@c0ffee]$ ltrace ./ex 
__libc_start_main(0x400506, 1, 0x7ffd71c6af78, 0x400520 <unfinished ...>
puts("\n\nThis is an innocent print.. \n"

This is an innocent print.. 

)                                                                             = 32
+++ exited (status 0) +++

Look, we notice the printf in our simple source was turned into a puts by GCC, this is due
to some compiler optimizations. Note that your compiled code is not always calling the
functions written in the source.[4]
Then, we have overrided the wrong function. :(
Let's rewrite our evil_printf library, overriding the right function this time:

	#define _GNU_SOURCE
	#include&lt;stdlib.h&gt;
	#include&lt;stdio.h&gt;
	int puts(const char *s){
		printf("Running very evil code...");
		exit(123);
	}

Recompile it into shared lib and rerun the example:

[ax@c0ffee]$ ./ex 
Running very evil code...[ax@c0ffee]$ 

Nice, it calls our library function instead of the real puts.
In this way the puts was totally overrided and oviously it doesn't work as expected by
the user anymore, in an evil scenario we probably want to be a little bit more stealth and
first of all do what the user expect, then something else. ;)
This means we have to rewrite the entire printf? 

No, thanks to the dynamic loading.

Dynamic loading is a mechanism by which a computer program can, at run time, load a
library (or other binary) into memory, retrieve the addresses of functions and variables
contained in the library, execute those functions or access those variables, and unload the
library from memory[5].

UNIX-like OSs provide dynamic loading with the C libdl.
The four functions dlopen(), dlsym(), dlclose(), dlerror() implement the interface to the
dynamic linking loader. 

void *dlsym(void *handle, const char *symbol) is used to obtain the address of a symbol in
a shared object or executable. We will use it to obtain the address of the real puts.
It takes a "handle" of a dynamic loaded shared object returned by dlopen(3) along with a
null-terminated symbol name, and returns the address where that symbol is loaded into memory. 
In this way we can call the original function when needed.

This case is a bit tricky because we are in an overrided function, we want the address of
the real puts in the libc, not our evil one. 

There are two special pseudo-handles that may be specified in handle, we are interested in
RTLD_NEXT.

RTLD_NEXT find the next occurrence of the desired symbol in the search order after the current object.
This allows one to provide a wrapper around a function in  another  shared object, so that,
for example, the definition of a function in a preloaded shared object
(see LD_PRELOAD in ld.so(8)) can find and invoke the "real" function provided in another
shared object (or for that matter, the "next" definition of the function in cases where there
are multiple layers of preloading).

We can write code like this:

	#define _GNU_SOURCE
	#include&lt;stdlib.h&gt;
	#include&lt;stdio.h&gt;
	#include&lt;dlfcn.h&gt;

	int puts(const char *s){
		typeof(puts) *old_puts;
		old_puts = dlsym(RTLD_NEXT, "puts");
		printf("Running very evil code...");
		(*old_puts)(s);
		exit(123);
	}

Compile it into a shared library again.										  

# gcc -Wall -c -o evil_printf.o evil_printf.c
# gcc -shared -ldl -o libevil_printf.so evil_printf.o

And execute it:

[ax@c0ffee]$ ./ex
Running very evil code...

This is an innocent print.. 


Probably, if our malicious code was a little more silent, a tipical user would not
noticed it.
